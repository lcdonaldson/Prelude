# Prelude

## Prelude is an atomic design system of building blocks for the components in your website or app. 

The goal of Prelude is to become a design system build on atomic css principles allowing you to compose smaller building blocks into full designs. Small composable units are the goal without all the bloat associated with other systems like bootstrap.
