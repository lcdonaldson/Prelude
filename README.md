# Prelude

## Prelude is a design system of building blocks for the components in your website or app. 

The goal of Prelude is to become a design system built on atomic css principles allowing you to compose smaller building blocks into full designs. Small composable units are the goal without all the bloat associated with other systems like bootstrap, or material design.

Prelude does not have a strict naming convention, developer ease of use and understanding is the end goal.

** The file structure needs to be changed. Files should not be in notes.
