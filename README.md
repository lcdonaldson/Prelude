# Prelude

## Prelude is an atomic design system of building blocks for the components in your website or app. 

### These building blocks are called Notes, Bars, Lines, Sheets, and Symphonies. 

These design elements are platform agnostic to be flexible in your project. Beyond the building blocks is a philosophy that prelude is built for flexibility with the modern web. Prelude was created with html, css grid, css custom properties and vanilla javascript. Preludes intention is to be light-weight and easy to implement and understand.

Enjoy Prelude
